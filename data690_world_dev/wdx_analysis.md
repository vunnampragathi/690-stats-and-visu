# ENVIRONMENT

## Introduction
An environment is everything that surrounds us, including both living and nonliving objects like water, soil, plants, and animals that can adapt to their environment.The environment is crucial to the continued existence of life on earth.Due to increase of trechnology environment is getting damanged.There are several greenhouses gases like co2,co,methane etc., which are released in to and polluting the nature.Other greenhouse gases exist in addition to CO2. These include ozone, nitrous oxide, methane, and water vapor. Earth would be a frozen wasteland if greenhouse gases weren't present. Greenhouse gases prevent the entire Earth's thermal energy from escaping into space, keeping our planet habitable.

##### What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?
In this project,i want to analyse the how the environment is changing due to increase of technology,population and pollution.For the below analyses i considered the data of forest area,air pollution and total green house gases of some countries like india,russia,brazil,china,united states and pakistan.

##### Why is it important to you and/or to others?
To obtain our food, water, fuel, medications, construction materials, and many other necessities, humans must interact with the environment. Science and technological advancements have made it easier for us to take advantage of the environment for our own gain, but we have also polluted the environment and damaged it. Environmental issues have a huge negative influence on people, having an impact on all aspects of human life, including health and socioeconomic development.

##### What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
i want to answer questions like 
how the future will be due to increase of environmental pollution
what is the importance of forests in the nature
how to control the emission of green house gases and pollution.

##### Where do you get the data and charts to help answer your questions 
i got the data and chart from the website worlddev.xyz

##### What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
to analyse the situation i just considerd the data of few countries and plotted the graphs showing how forest area playing role in the protection of enivronment.i want to get the awareness among the people about the damages we are doing to the environment.damange to environment is damage to our future generations.

Following are some of the most common solutions to the environmental issue:
Replacing disposal items with reusable items.
avoiding the use of paper.
Conserving water and electricity.
Supporting environmental friendly practices.
Recycling waste to conserve natural resources.

## Analyses

### Bar chart showing the total forest area in selected countries
![forest area bar chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112585191/198904292-2f119b09-d33b-40be-bc20-257a84cecc20.png)

from the above bar chart it is obsereved that brazil has highest area,it has 60% of total land as forests.russia is in the second place next is united staets, india china and last is pakistan.whereas pakistan has very forest area less than 10% of total land.from the above chart we can say that brazil has good atmospehric conditions compared to the other countries.

### pie chart showing the total green house gases emissions

from the above pie chart it is obserevd that china has higest green house gas emissions it has approximately about 50% compared to other countries.next highest  green house gas emissions is in united states,next is india and pakistan has very less amount of green house gas emissions.from this we can assume that china is the more pollutant country and pakistan is less pollutant compared to other countries.

### line chart showing annual exposure of air pollution from 2010 to 2017

from the above line chart it is observed that india is in first place in terms of polluted air,but compared to 2010 the pollution level is reduced in the 2017.china is in second place intially but it pollution levels are decreased as the years passed it is in the 3 rd place in 2017.it seems that USA has very fresh air.

### scatter plot showing total forest VS total green house gas emissions across all the countries

from the above scatter plot it is observed that china has highest green house gases emissions compared to all other countries with forest area approximately about 20% of total land.next place is for usa.it seems that as the forest area reduces there is chance of more emmission of green house gases.

### scatter plot showing total forest VS total air pollution across all the countries
![forest area vs air pollution scatter plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112585191/198905578-782d40ec-5585-40e1-af1d-75178c8147b9.png)

from the above scatter plot it is obserevd that as the forest area increas the amount of air pollution caused is less.

### scatter plot showing total green house gas VS total air pollution across all the countries
![air pollution vs gas emissions scatter plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112585191/198905850-9636a0e9-98e8-4a23-b57c-748f88b167cc.png)

from the above scatter plot it is obserevd that emission of green house gases and air pollution has linear relationship, as the emission of green house gases increases the air pollution is also increasing.


### Conclusion:
Environment plays a crucial role in everyones life.so protecting environment is everyones duty.from the above analysis it is obseverd that forest area has linear relationship with both emission of green house gases and air pollution.to protect our environment we need to increase the forest area and should reduce the use of itmes causing the air pollution and release of greenhouse gases. Because they not only damaging the environment they are very harmful for human health,increase in air pollution and green house gases will result in several health issues for humans.
